# BattleTeam

This is a college's project for IOS Programming Fundamentals course. In this project I demonstrated things I learned through the course. 

## Requirements
For your final project, you are requested to use swift and develop an application to simulation a battle among teams. The following components are ingredients for a battle:
Player: Complete the implementation of player to fulfill the requirements of the project.

Team: A class team is a container that contains players belonging to the same team. A team is identified by a color and a name. A team has a location center and a territory radius. The territory radius is equal to 10 multiplied by the number of team members.
Two teams will start the battle once they share a territory. If all team members of a team are dead, the team will lose the game. 

Once the game begins, there are five teams with random number of players (between 1 and 20) in each team. The location of the teams is random, but place them not very far from each other. Eventually, all teams will move toward the (0,0) of the map. And at any time during the migration, if a team conflicts with othersâ€™ territory, they will start a battle. Finally, one team is the winner of the match whole game.
You are requested to create a project in XCode and represent graphics for your battle. In your scene, represent each team with a shape. Note that more populated groups are required to be represented larger. Further, use the distinct color for a team for the illustration.
